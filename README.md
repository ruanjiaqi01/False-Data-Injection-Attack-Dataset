# False Data Injection Attack Dataset
The dataset includes normal operation data and false data injection attack samples of 30-bus and 118-bus power systems.

For each power system benchmark, there are three data files: Admittance Matrix, Normal Operation Data in 1-min, Attack Samples.

The data are recorded with state estimation results, which contains voltage magnitudes and phase angles of all buses.

More details can be found in the article "Super-Resolution Perception Assisted Spatiotemporal Graph Deep Learning against False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid.
